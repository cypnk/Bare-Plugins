# Bare-Plugins
A set of extensions for the [Bare](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare) blog

These are completely optional and Bare will function on its own.


The following plugins are ready to install:
- [firewall](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/firewall): A simple speedbump plugin to reduce some malicious behavior
- [templates](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/templates): Enables overriding the default templates with your own, entirely different, HTML
- [render](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/render): A helper to build forms and other page fragments, which can be used by other plugins
- [captcha](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/captcha): A text on image generator for form field validation, used with other plugins
- [monsterid](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/monsterid): A random avatar generator based on the [original](https://github.com/splitbrain/monsterID), used with other plugins


These are still under development and will be non-functional and/or contain bugs:
- [membership](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/membership): A user login and registration helper for use with other plugins
- [editor](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/editor): A helper to quickly create new posts or modify existing ones
- [moderation](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/moderation): A content filtering helper to create responses to certain user activities
