# Bare-Plugins
A set of extensions for the [Bare](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare) blog

These are completely optional and Bare will function on its own.

These are still under development and may contain bugs.

The following plugins are ready to install:
- [firewall](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/firewall): A simple speedbump plugin to reduce some malicious behavior
- [templates](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare-Plugins/tree/master/templates): Enables overriding the default templates with your own, entirely different, HTML
