# Bare Firewall

This is a simple speedbump plugin to reduce some malicious behavior.  
This is the plugin version of the [standalone firewall](https://github.com/cypnk/Firewall) and has been modified to  
run specifically with Bare.

To install, upload the firewall folder to the PLUGINS directory and add 'firewall' to  
PLUGINS_ENABLED in the main [index.php](https://github.com/cypnk/Bare/blob/master/index.php) or add to 'plugins_enabled' in *config.json*.  
To ensure best performance, add firewall as the first plugin in that list.
