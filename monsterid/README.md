# Bare MonsterID

This is an avatar generator plugin based on the original [monsterID](https://github.com/splitbrain/monsterID) and an [updated version](https://github.com/cypnk/monsterID). Most of the plugin settings can be set in Bare's *config.json*, if used.

Monster IDs can be generated by visiting */monsterid/seed* or */monsterid/seed/size* URLs on your Bare blog's home directory or *monsterid* if session based generating is enabled in settings. Otherwise, this plugin's generator must be called by another plugin. The "seed" is a string used to indicate some type of visitor identification depending on which code created the avatar URL. The seed defaults to the current visitor's session data when not given and "size" filtered to stay between 'monster_id_min' and 'monster_id_max' values.
